My Random TODO list for the zombie game.


make better levels. 
Load a different background for each level.  

Use the mouse to move the Zombie, not just keyboard.

Add AI to the game to make it more interesting.  
DONE Add walls??  Some how make the game interesting and more playable.

Add sound!!

DONE Add scoring; time level took to complete over the number of Zombies 
saved.

DONE Display the number of people a person has to save in a level.

DONE Allow the hero to resue other people after he has completed the save 
count.
    -Have a message saying, if you wish to continue type ' '.

Add difference accounts.  Look into sqlite3 to do this.

go once through the levels trying to rescue the peoplein the middle you have
to find a zombie antidote.  after the antidote has been retrieved you must
rescue all the zombies in the levels you already played by turning them into
people and bringing them into the safezone.  at the end of the game you will
have saved mankind.
