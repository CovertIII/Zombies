My Random TODO list for the zombie game.
========================================

When open level to test it, skip all the database stuff.

Insert uppercase letters in SDL

Load splash logo in data_interface render and directions and credits

Load a different background for each level. -- Think of a png file that can be generated for each level.



DONE Use the mouse to move the hero, not just keyboard.

DONE Add sound!!

DONE Add walls??  Some how make the game interesting and more playable.

DONE Add scoring; time level took to complete over the number of Zombies 
saved.

DONE Display the number of people a person has to save in a level.

DONE Allow the hero to resue other people after he has completed the save 
count.

DONE Have a message saying, if you wish to continue type ' '.

DONE Add different accounts.  Look into sqlite3 to do this.
