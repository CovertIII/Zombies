My Random TODO list for the zombie game.
========================================

Fixe the bug where the textures don't work.

Allow for indefinate amount of music tracks and detect when there are no more (like i do for the levels).

Auto generate a texture with the walls on it for each level when loading a level.
   This will save on resources so the calculations for each wall aren't done on each frame.

Have an over world map and allow people to pick up where they left off since last playing the game.

Insert uppercase letters in SDL

Load splash logo in data_interface render and directions and credits

String length check on USERDATA to start game

DONE Load a different background for each level. -- Think of a png file that can be generated for each level.

DONE When open level to test it, skip all the database stuff.

DONE Use the mouse to move the hero, not just keyboard.

DONE Add sound!!

DONE Add walls??  Some how make the game interesting and more playable.

DONE Add scoring; time level took to complete over the number of Zombies 
saved.

DONE Display the number of people a person has to save in a level.

DONE Allow the hero to resue other people after he has completed the save 
count.

DONE Have a message saying, if you wish to continue type ' '.

DONE Add different accounts.  Look into sqlite3 to do this.
